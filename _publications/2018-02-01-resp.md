abstract: 'Local factors, like orographic effects and temperature, and longer range processes that create remote dependence, like the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection, both impact local and regional weather patterns. Many statistical methods, however, can only account for either local or remote covariates. While existing methods can model important phenomena like rainfall and temperature, improvements are possible by introducing new methods that simultaneously account for the effects of local and remote covariates. We propose a geostatistical model that uses covariates observed on a spatially remote domain to improve locally-driven models of a spatial process. Our model draws on ideas from spatially varying coefficient models, spatial basis functions, and predictive processes to overcome modeling challenges for teleconnections. We adopt a hierarchical Bayesian framework to conduct inference and make predictions to demonstrate how precipitation in Colorado is more accurately modeled by accounting for teleconnection effects with Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures. We also discuss physical motivations and interpretations for our model.'
