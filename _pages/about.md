Bio
======

I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University, working with Alan Gelfand.  I received my PhD from the Department of Statistics at Colorado State University, under the supervision of [Jennifer A. Hoeting](http://www.stat.colostate.edu/~jah/). I study problems in Bayesian spatial modeling and estimation as applied to the geosciences.  My research extends theory and methods for spatial models and computational techniques to account for physical principles important to climatology, including teleconnection and extremal dependence.

I want to improve scientistsâ€™ ability to use data to understand how people interact with the natural world.  Exploring how statistics helps solve critical problems ensures we do not ignore potential biases as we develop solutions for a sustainable future.
